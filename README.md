# General Insight:
•Out of the 1200 employees, 178 of them going to leave INX Future Inc data analytics company (indicating a 15% attrition rate).

# Solutions of the Questions above:
  - The employees with educational level as Bachelor (38%) and Masters (23%), constitutes higher count of attrition. However, 19% of total employees with education level ‘Below College’ constitutes higher rate of attrition followed by ‘Bachelor’ and ‘College’ (15%).
  - The employees with educational backgrounds in the field of Life Sciences (37%), Medical (25%) and Marketing (17%), indicates higher count of attrition.
  - The maximum number of employees between 26 - 35 age, depicts high attrition count (90 employees). However, the number of employees in the age group 18-25, depicts 37% of attrition rate (of that age group) which is 20% (37/178) of the total attrition count.
  - Approximately 55% of the employees leaving the company, have expressed very high/ high satisfaction with the Job Role.
  - The employees from the job role of sales executive (44), developer (40), sales representative (24), research scientist (13) and laboratory technician (13) show high attrition.
  - The low salary hike % of employees (between 10% - 15%) indicates the high attrition rate.
  - The 46 employees after gaining one year of work experience and, 23 employees after 2 years of experience, are leaving the company. Out of those 46 employees, 32 employees are freshers and have total experience of only one year.

# Final Conclusion:
